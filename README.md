# ðŸ“¦ Amazon Reviews Sentiment Classification â€“ NLP Final Project
This is the final Project for CSCI 3832 for Adam Wuth, Benjamin Kohav, Noah Vilas, Aiden Devine, Evan Zachary

## Overview
This project uses different models to predict star ratings (1 to 5) from Amazon product reviews written in 2023. We compare different model architectures (e.g., N-gram models vs. DistilBERT) to evaluate how well they classify sentiment in real-world amazon review data.



## Final Results(all tested on the same dataset created in the make_dataset notebook)
1. RNN model Accuracy:20.1%
2.  Bigram model Accuracy:22%
3.  Trigram model Accuracy:placeholder
4. GRU Accuracy:46.5%
5. DilstillBERT Accuracy:
## Different Parts of the code
In this repository, you will find 6 notebooks:
1. Make_Dataset.ipynb
2. DistillBERT.ipynb

Each notebook holds a different model. In order to recreate our results, you only need to follow the instructions and run the code in each notebook.<br/>

## Test
Dataset:McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023<br/>
Years Filtered: Only 2023 reviews<br/>
Source Domains: 34 Amazon product categories<br/>
Preprocessing:<br/>
Filter by timestamp, review type and category<br/>
Map rating to label classes 0â€“4<br/>
Split:80% training, 20% validation<br/>
**To recreate the project, use the make dataset notebook**<br/>
